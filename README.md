#This repository demonstrates the use of HTML tags, including the structure of an HTML document, styling headers with CSS, and formatting paragraphs. The code is organized into different sections to illustrate various elements and their attributes. The HTML document is enclosed within the <html> tag.
Metadata, such as the title and styles, is placed within the <head> section.
The content of the webpage is included in the <body> section.
Various heading elements (h1, h2, h3, etc.) are used to show different font sizes and styles.Custom CSS is applied to the headings using the <style> tag inside the <head> section. The <p> tag is used for adding blocks of text.
Example paragraphs use placeholder text to demonstrate paragraph formatting.
